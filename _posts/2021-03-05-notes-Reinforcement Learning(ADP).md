If we would like to talk about reinforcement learning, we cannot leave without dynamic programming.

Since this project is for energy system. I would like to use the terminology in energy area.(yes, I am still junior in this area.) 

There are three pigments in dynamic programming, one is the state variable. The second is action, sometimes we can use decision(this is usually used in the stochastic programming area). The last is the transition function.



###### Background

Our problem can be considered into the economic dispatch problem. If in a more general way, this is a resource allocation problem. We are trying to distribute energy resources( such as electric power grid and other forms of energy allocation wind/gas/heat) to serve different types of demand. [[1]](#1).
