#### **Course Description**

The course introduces the students to fundamental notions of multivariate analysis, convex analysis, thetheory and methods of nonlinear optimization. It begins with reviewing necessary notions of linear algebra and analysis and continues with discussing properties and representation of convex sets, propertiesof convex functions, convexity criteria, necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality for linear andnonlinear optimization problems with and without constraints.  Examples of optimization problems aredrawn from economics, business, and finance.
