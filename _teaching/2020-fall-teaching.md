#### **Course Description**

This course introduces the students to mathematical models and computational methods for static and dynamic optimization problems occurring in finance. We shall discuss linear and non-linear optimization models of finance, dynamic (sequential) optimization, optimization under uncertainty, mathematical models of risk, and their application. Additionally, duality theory and its use in economics and finance will be stresses. The students will be familiarized with the concept of risk and risk-aversion. The models involve knowledge of probability, optimality conditions, duality, and basic numerical methods. Special attention will be paid to portfolio optimization and to risk management problems.

#### Content

1. Formulate optimization problems associated with various problems in quantitative finance and actuarial mathematics such as dedication problems, immunized bond portfolio model, portfolio optimization using mean-variance models or coherent measures of risk, and using risk constraints of different kinds, tracking an index, etc.
2. Interpret the economic meaning of dual variables and use them in the sensitivity analysis.
3. Use typical modeling techniques of combinatorial optimization such as logical bounds and logical constraints.
4. Understand the concept of risk and be able to formulate and apply several mathematical models of risk based on utility functions, distortions, coherent measures of risk, and risk-constraints.
5. Calculate the efficient frontier determined by a mean-risk model; use the one-fund and two-fund theorems.
6. Use the concept of stochastic orders, be aware of their relation to risk measures, and to utility functions and distortions.
7. Formulate finite-horizon dynamic optimization problems based on Markov and non- Markov discrete-time processes.
8. Apply stochastic optimization methods for option pricing and for asset/liability management.
9. Be able to formulate a two-stage risk-averse portfolio optimization problem.
